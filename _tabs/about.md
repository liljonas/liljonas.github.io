I’m Youness Oumlil, a cybersecurity graduate with a Distinction in MSc Cyber Security from Ravensbourne University. My main focus lies in offensive security — from vulnerability exploitation and web application testing to exploit and rootkit development.

I’ve built hands-on projects including a Windows rootkit, a deliberately insecure OWASP-based web app for secure coding practice, and a privilege access management system.

I’m passionate about pentesting, CTF challenges, and security research, constantly improving my technical skills through HackTheBox, TryHackMe, and global security conferences like BlackHat, DEF CON, and OWASP.

When I’m not exploring exploits, you’ll probably find me experimenting with code, diving into low-level system internals, or contributing to cybersecurity communities.
